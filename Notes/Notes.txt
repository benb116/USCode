Use cleanup.py to strip and clean

"master" branch of the repo is USCode + all laws that have been signed

Some parts of some laws add brand new material (i.e. not in an specific section)
    Maybe have a "Statutes at Large" folder for material that hasn't been classified
    As classification tables come out, move material from SAL to USC
        Squash classification commits with creation commits

Much of a law is CRUD operations on existing law
    Often CRUD is specified in reference to public laws (as amended), not to USC
        e.g. if "section 3 of PL 116-259" is classified in 52 USC 1234, the law/amendments may say "change section 2 of the law", and section 2 will have to be translated to a USC location (maybe 52 USC 1233)
            Classification table lookup could help to map one to the other.
    If it says "section 123 of Short Title (23 USC 4321)", 4321 may not be the exact section
        Need to consult classification table to be exact
    Titles within a law may have different short titles

Will have to do language parsing
    Improved if use XML of bill text
        Bill and USC xml are slightly different
    Add references to:
        "under the provisions of paragraphs (3), (4), and (5) of section 11 of the Headquarters Agreement with the United Nations (61 Stat. 758)"
        <ref href="/us/stat/61/758">61 Stat. 758</ref>

Maintain USC in XML form
    Export a plaintext version?

Each bill is a branch off of master
    Branch name is Congress#-Bill# (e.g. 116-HR8768)
    Initial commit title is branch name + short title
    Initial commit message is full title
    Add sponsors as co-authors

    Any bill amendments are branches off of the bill branch
        If amendment is passed, it is pulled into bill branch
    A merge occurs when the president signs the bill into law

        Init the repo
        Add section in 98-473 commit
        Amend in three new commits

    1) download code as is currently and sanitize, but don't put it into git.
        Prob need to refrain from deleting bad sections
    2) Run the "go back in time" functionality to force the code as far back in time as possible
    3) Initialize in git
    4) Run the "go back in time" functionality *in reverse*, committing after each law. State should be same as when downloaded
    5) Continue as normal

When a new bill is introduced
    $ git checkout -b 117-HR127

** There are two identifier="/us/usc/t42/s5105/a/4" **

Each title of the Code is subdivided into a combination of smaller units such as subtitles, chapters, subchapters, parts, subparts, and sections, not necessarily in that order. Sections are often subdivided into a combination of smaller units such as subsections, paragraphs, subparagraphs, clauses, subclauses, and items. In the case of a positive law title, the units are determined by Congress in the laws that enact and later amend the title. In the case of a non-positive law title, the organization of the title since 1926 has been determined by the editors of the Code and has generally followed the organization of the underlying acts as much as possible.

(d) Special Rule For Amendments.—On the date of enactment of H.R. 3684 (117th Congress)—
    (1) subsections (a), (b), and (c) of this section, the amendments made by such subsections, section 201 of the Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2021 (Public Law 117–44), and the amendments made by such section shall cease to be effective;
    (2) the text of the laws amended by subsections (a), (b), and (c) of this section and section 201 of the Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2021 (Public Law 117–44) shall revert back so as to read as the text read on September 30, 2021; and
    (3) the amendments made by H.R. 3684 (117th Congress) shall be executed as if this section and section 201 of the Surface Transportation Extension Act had not been enacted.
    If H.R. 3684 (117th Congress) is enacted before the date of enactment of this Act, this Act shall not take effect and the provisions of this Act shall not be executed.
